# 🚀 Codeweek

**Codeweek** is a visual coding progress tracker built with **Vanilla JavaScript**, designed to help developers track their coding activity, analyze progress, and build consistent development habits over time.

This project was developed primarily as a **portfolio project** and continues to evolve with new features and improvements. The long-term goal is to deploy it as a live, production-ready application.
